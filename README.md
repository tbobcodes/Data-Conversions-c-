# Data-Conversions-c#-

This is a small coding challenge project that allowed to me understand conversions

I learned cast conversion where the conversion rounds down(truncated the result)
I learned how to use the convert helper method for a result that rounds up the result
I learned a lot of new data types that store different amount of information like
UShort, long, decimal, float.
